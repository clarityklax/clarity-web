Clarity Notes is a modern, opinionated note taking application built for workers in tech: software engineers, engineering managers, product managers, designers, etc. It integrates tightly with tools you already use (Gmail, Google Calendar) to give you the right context at the right time:
  * Start taking notes for the meeting you're currently at or just finished, all meeting context (invitees, topic, agenda) will be there, and shared with a click of a button.
  * Make a notes public to be easily shareble with everyone that has a link
  * Search through your notes and talk to a chatbot to help you organize them
  * Find missing todos across all your notes
  * Send an email to Clarity Notes and it's turned into a note

Notes is still very much a work in progress. You can see the current roadmap [here](https://notes.clarity.hr/public-notes/9a99169c-1dee-4869-b4be-3da46cac418d):
