Hi,

I'm [Ivan Klaric](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iklaric/), a software engineer (these days mostly a manager) that occasionally [writes](https://medium.com/@ivanklaric). I like to think I bring clarity to engineering teams, hence the domain (and the name of the legal entity behind it).

 I also love building stuff. Most recent example is my take on a [note taking application](https://notes.clarity.hr) that I've been occassionally working on since late 2024. Feel free to give it a spin and let me know what you think.
